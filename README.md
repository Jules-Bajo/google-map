Is a short project about how to generate location using using Google Geocode API.

The first program #Google_map_search.py# is use to generate the logitude and latitude of a particular pincode location in India 
and save it at # generated_location.xlsx #.

The second program # Python_to_mysql.py # is use to load the generated data in the mysqle database.

I develop this program for Sharp india product website (http://www.sharp-india.in/contact/store-location/)
